#### Saks

Source for my static brand site, [placeholder](https://site.com), built with React. Everyone knows React is a great alternative for complex SPAs; turns out it's also great for organizing simple static projects!

#### Code

The site was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) and ejected to add Webpack support for SASS, which was not natively supported by CRA at the time of creation. Emails are sent using Amazon's Gateway API and AWS Lambda. Package management is with Yarn.

#### Look & Feel

I've used the Cooper Hewitt font family and inspiration from the Cooper Hewitt Museum in New York in assembling the look and feel.
