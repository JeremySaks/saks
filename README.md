## Saks

Source for my static personal site, [saks.io](https://saks.io), built with React. React is a great alternative for complex SPAs; it's also great for organizing simple static projects!

#### Code

The site was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) and ejected to add Webpack support for SASS, which was not natively supported by CRA at the time of creation. Emails are sent using Amazon's Gateway API and AWS Lambda. Yarn is used for package management.

#### Look & Feel

Look and feel is inspired by New York's Cooper Hewitt Museum and utilizes the [Cooper Hewitt](https://www.cooperhewitt.org/open-source-at-cooper-hewitt/cooper-hewitt-the-typeface-by-chester-jenkins/) font family.
